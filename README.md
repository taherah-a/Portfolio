# Portfolio

I'm Taherah Abbas and I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a major in Cognitive Science (with a specialization in Design and Interaction) and a minor in Communications.
Through the projects I've worked on, I have learnt how to work as a teamto prioritize the user but also work within set guidelines. 
I have gone beyond creating and designing just for the user. 
A key element when working on these projects is marketing and communicating our ideas clearly through pitche slides or slide decks explaining our design concept and process. 
Interaction design and product design is all about user research, brainstorming, and being detail oriented. 
The design process is an iteratice process from continuous user testing to prototyping.
I'm confident that I can adapt and learn the ropes as necessary. 
I have a strong academic background in design and cognitive science which has helped to lay the foundation for all projects I have worked on.
I'm very excited and passionate about working with you. 

Thank you for taking the time to go through my portfolio. 
Feel free to contact me if you'd like to discuss my work more!
